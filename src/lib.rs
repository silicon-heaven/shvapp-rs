/// For performance reasons, boxing is avoided in any hot path. For example, in
/// `parse`, a custom error `enum` is defined. This is because the error is hit
/// and handled during normal execution when a partial frame is received on a
/// socket. `std::error::Error` is implemented for `parse::Error` which allows
/// it to be converted to `Box<dyn std::error::Error>`.
